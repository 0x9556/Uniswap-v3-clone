# Mathematics

$L =\sqrt{xy}$

**L is the amount of liquidity**

$\sqrt P = \sqrt{\frac yx}$

**y/x is the price of token 0 in terms of 1**

$L = \frac {\bigtriangleup y }{\bigtriangleup \sqrt P}$

**we will not store x and y in the contracts**

---

$\bigtriangleup y  = \bigtriangleup \sqrt P L$

$\bigtriangleup x = \bigtriangleup \frac {1}{\sqrt P} L$

# Ticks

$p(i) = 1.0001^i$

$\sqrt {p(i)} = 1.0001^\frac 1 2$

Uniswap V3 stores $\sqrt P$ as a fixed point Q64.96 number, which is a rational number that uses 64 bits for the integer part and 96 bits for the fractional part.

Thus, prices are within the range:$[2^{-128},2^{128}]$

And ticks are within the range:$[log_{1.0001}2^{-128},log_{1.0001}2^{128}] = [-887272,887272]$

# Calculate amount0 , amount1 of mint function

```
function mint(address owner, int24 lowerTick, int24 upperTick, uint128 amount, bytes calldata data)
    external
    returns(uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1);
```

$L = \frac {\bigtriangleup y }{\bigtriangleup \sqrt P}$

$\bigtriangleup y = \bigtriangleup \sqrt P L$

$\bigtriangleup x = \bigtriangleup \frac {1} {\sqrt P}L$

# Tick Bitmap Index

$wordpos = tickindex>>8$

$bitpos = tickindex\%256$

---

Since tickindex is 24bits

And $wordpos = tickindex>>8$

Thus wordpos is 16bits

bitpos is 8 bits
